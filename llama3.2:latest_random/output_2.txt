PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language) is a standard language used to define planning problems and domains in artificial intelligence. It was developed by the Planning Domain Definition Group, an organization that includes experts from various fields such as computer science, engineering, and cognitive psychology.

PDDL provides a way to formally specify the rules, constraints, and goals of a planning problem, making it easier for planners (computer programs) to generate solutions. The language is used in both research and industry applications, including robotics, supply chain management, and logistics.

A PDDL domain is defined by three main components:

1. **Problem**: This specifies the goal of the planning problem, which is typically represented as a list of actions that can be performed.
2. **Domain**: This defines the rules and constraints that govern the behavior of the agents in the problem. The domain includes:
 * **Predicates**: statements that describe the state of the world (e.g., "the block is on the table").
 * **Actions**: statements that describe what actions can be taken to change the state of the world.
 * **Init**: the initial state of the world.
3. **Initiation Conditions**: These specify the conditions under which the planning process begins.

PDDL also provides a set of predefined domains and problems, including classic examples like the "block world" and "traveling salesman problem".

The main benefits of using PDDL include:

* **Standardization**: Ensures that planners can understand and solve problems from different domains.
* **Formal specification**: Allows for precise definition of planning problems and constraints.
* **Efficient planning**: Enables efficient solution generation and search.

PDDL is widely used in the field of artificial intelligence, particularly in areas like robotics, autonomous vehicles, and supply chain optimization.
