PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language) is a language used to define planning problems in Artificial Intelligence (AI). It's a formal language that allows humans and computers to describe complex planning tasks, making it easier for AI systems to solve them.

In traditional planning problems, a goal must be achieved by performing a sequence of actions. PDDL provides a way to formally represent these problems using a set of rules, objects, actions, and constraints.

Here are some key components of PDDL:

1. **Domains**: A domain is the overall structure of a problem, including the types of objects, actions, and constraints that exist in it.
2. **Problem instances**: A problem instance is a specific version of a domain with particular values assigned to its variables (e.g., which objects are present, where they're located).
3. **Actions**: An action represents a single step that can be taken in the world. Actions have parameters (input values) and effects (output values), which describe what happens when the action is executed.
4. **Preconditions** (precond): A precondition specifies the conditions under which an action can be executed. If these conditions are not met, the action cannot be performed.
5. **Effects**: An effect describes the outcome of executing an action.

PDDL provides a set of syntax rules and semantics that ensure consistency between domain definitions and problem instances. This allows for the creation of large, complex planning domains with a wide range of applications.

Some common use cases for PDDL include:

* **Robotics**: PDDL is often used to plan motion and navigation tasks for robots.
* **Supply Chain Management**: PDDL can be used to model and optimize logistics operations.
* **Healthcare**: PDDL may be applied to planning tasks in medical procedures, such as surgery or medication administration.

PDDL has many variants and extensions, including:

* **PlanDB**: A knowledge representation format for storing domain definitions and problem instances.
* **SMT-LIB**: A library of constraints that can be used with PDDL to solve planning problems.

Overall, PDDL provides a powerful tool for defining complex planning tasks in AI systems.
